# Tally Analysis

## Overview
This Python script is designed to analyze numerical data from a file, assuming that the data is formatted with each point on a new line. It calculates and prints key statistics such as the sample mean, sample variance, and sample standard deviation.

## Usage
1. Replace `'survey.txt'` in the `open` function with the path to your data file.
2. Ensure that the data in the file is formatted with each data point on a new line.

## How to Run
Execute the script by running the `main` function. The statistics will be computed and displayed in the console.

```bash
python script.py
